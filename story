Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocidile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back for more fruits since he loved them.
As days passed by, the crocidile and the monkey became good friends.
